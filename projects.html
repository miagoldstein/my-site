                    <h5>Sentence Modeling (Click the pic !! )</h5>
                    <p>Historically, two separate mathematical frameworks are used to model sentences: 
                        a pregroup for grammar and a collection of vector spaces for semantic meaning. 
                        Through category theory a third framework was constructed, by Coecke, Sadrzadeh, 
                        and Clark, simultaneously modeling both the grammar and the meaning of a sentence. 
                        Each framework induces a monoidal category, which means that it exhibits certain 
                        properties akin to associativity and multiplicative identity. The third frameworkâ€™s 
                        construction requires showing that the product category of two monoidal categories is 
                        again monoidal.

                    <h5>Opinion Dynamics (Click the pic !! )</h5>
                    <p>Existing models of opinion dynamics have been developed using directed graphs to 
                        represent (social) networks and a cellular sheaf for the opinion space of agents 
                        in the network. These models are functors from the free category of a graph with 
                        a poset relation to the category of vector spaces. In this project we generalize 
                        this functor to a map of simplicial sets and verify previous theorems and examples 
                        carry over, while allowing for "higher homotopical data." This talk does not assume 
                        any prior knowledge of category theory and instead uses the language of vertices, 
                        edges, triangles, vector spaces, and matrices.

                        having creative outlets to be very important. This is a painting I made my
                        senoir year of highschool. Oil on canvas.

                    <p> At SUNY New Paltz I been lucky to have taken a few courses on costume production 
                        through the theatre department. I cut, stitched and pressed every component of 
                        this garment.
